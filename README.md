How to run the application.

I have used simple python server.
1) Go to your working directory and run "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" command at the terminal.
2) Go to browser url and type  "http://localhost:8000/"
3) To see output, right click and Inspect as I have done Console.log();


I did a bit of research about the Web Socket.

I had difficulty in understanding what to and how to do and after a while I could start with code challenge.

Up to some extent I was successful in fixing some of the issues.

I have spent 4 hrs working on this and I think I may need more guidance to work on this code challenge.
